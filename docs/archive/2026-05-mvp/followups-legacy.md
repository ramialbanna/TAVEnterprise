## MANHEIM_LOOKUP_MODE="worker" — implemented, not yet enabled in staging/production

`MANHEIM_LOOKUP_MODE="worker"` routes ingest valuation through tav-intelligence-worker
(`src/valuation/workerClient.ts`). The code is complete but the flag stays `"direct"` in all
wrangler.toml env blocks until the following operational prerequisites are met.

**Current behavior when set to "worker":**
- Main worker POSTs to `/mmr/vin` or `/mmr/year-make-model` on tav-intelligence-worker.
- Auth: `x-tav-service-secret` header must match `INTEL_SERVICE_SECRET` on the intelligence worker.
- Timeout: 5s hard deadline. Timeout → `WorkerTimeoutError` → `ingest.mmr_worker_failed` log → mmrResult=null (non-blocking).
- 429 → `WorkerRateLimitError` → same fallback. 5xx → `WorkerUnavailableError` → same fallback.
- Rate-limit guard: ingest calls receive service identity (`service@tav-internal`), not a user email — they do not exhaust per-user quota.
- On success, `MmrResponseEnvelope` is mapped to `MmrResult`; valuation snapshot is written; scoring uses the returned value.

Full UAT validation plan: `docs/manheim-uat-validation-plan.md`

**Cox sandbox confirmed (2026-05-08, MMR 1.4 OpenAPI):**
- [x] Vendor profile: Cox Bridge 2.
- [x] Grant type: `client_credentials` with HTTP Basic Auth on token endpoint.
- [x] Scope: `wholesale-valuations.vehicle.mmr-ext.get`.
- [x] MMR base: `https://sandbox.api.coxautoinc.com/wholesale-valuations/vehicle/mmr` (note trailing `/mmr`).
- [x] VIN endpoint: `GET /vin/{vin}` (path-segment).
- [x] YMMT endpoint: `GET /search/{year}/{makename}/{modelname}/{bodyname}` — `bodyname` (trim) REQUIRED.
- [x] Code wired to MMR 1.4 paths in `manheimHttp.ts` `buildVinUrl` / `buildYmmUrl`; trim threaded across boundary in `workerClient.ts`; trimless YMM short-circuits to null envelope.

**Resolved by Cox MMR 1.4 guide (2026-05-08):**
- [x] `odometer` supported as a query param on both `/vin/{vin}` and `/search/...` — code now sends it.
- [x] Response shape: `adjustedPricing.wholesale.{average,above,below}` + `adjustedPricing.retail.{average,above,below}` (when `include=retail`) + `sampleSize`. `extractManheimDistribution` updated to extract retail tiers.
- [x] `evbh` validated to integer in `[75, 100]` inclusive; out-of-range silently dropped.
- [x] `zipCode` (not `zip`) supported as a query param.
- [x] `include` query supports `retail`, `forecast`, `historical`, `ci` (`ci` stripped on Search/YMMT). Behavior gated by `MANHEIM_INCLUDE_*` env flags; default conservative (no flags set → no `include` param).

**Resolved by sandbox UAT 2026-05-08 (see `docs/manheim-uat-validation-plan.md` §14):**
- [x] Token URL works against Cox sandbox (HTTP 200, scope accepted, `Bearer` token, `expires_in: 86400`).
- [x] Sandbox VIN/YMMT test data validated: VIN `1FT8W3BT1SEC27066` returns 2025 Ford F-350SD wholesale tiers; no-data VIN `1FT8W3BT199999999` returns 404 → null envelope; YMMT `2025 / Acura / ADX AWD / 4D SUV` returns wholesale tiers.
- [x] Response shape confirmed: `adjustedPricing.wholesale.{above,average,below}` + `sampleSize` (string) match the parser's expectations on real Cox responses.
- [x] `include=retail` flag mechanically works on VIN. **Non-core for TAV (wholesale-only).** No further retail parser or persistence work planned; raw retail payload is preserved for opportunistic use only.

**Open Cox blockers:** none. (All previously-listed blockers resolved by sandbox UAT.)

**Business decision (2026-05-08): TAV is wholesale-only.** Retail values are not
a core requirement. Do not add `mmr_retail_avg` / `mmr_retail_rough` columns to
`tav.valuation_snapshots`. Do not extend the parser or scoring around retail
data. Retail remains optional context preserved on the raw `mmr_payload` only.

**Deferred Cox features (logged for future phases):**
- [ ] **`include=ci` sandbox validation on VIN** — turn `MANHEIM_INCLUDE_CI=true` on, confirm `confidenceInterval` populates on `/vin/{vin}` and is correctly stripped on Search/YMMT (no 4xx, no `ci` token in the URL).
- [ ] **`include=forecast` / `include=historical` sandbox validation** — only pursue if these sections add wholesale-pricing signal (e.g. forecast-based stale detection). Skip if they are retail-flavored only.
- [ ] **Reference-sync from `mmr-lookup` endpoints** — Cox `/mmr-lookup` is the future source-of-truth for make/model/trim alias data (currently `mmr_reference_makes` / `mmr_reference_models` / `mmr_make_aliases` / `mmr_model_aliases` are seeded by hand and `bodyname` has no alias table). Plan: build a periodic job that pulls canonical strings from `/mmr-lookup` and refreshes the reference tables.
- [ ] VIN disambiguation variants `/vin/{vin}/{subseries}` and `/vin/{vin}/{subseries}/{transmission}`.
- [ ] Long-form YMMT path `/search/years/{year}/makes/{make}/models/{model}/trims/{bodyname}`.
- [ ] Trim alias table (currently pass-through; listing trims may not match Cox `bodyname` strings).
- [ ] Wire `forecast`, `historical`, `confidenceInterval` into `extractManheimDistribution` only if a wholesale-relevant downstream consumer needs them. Today only `wholesale` (and a non-core `retail`) tier is parsed.
- [ ] Reference endpoints `/colors`, `/edition`, `/grades`, `/regions`, `/regions/auction/id/{auction_id}`, `/regions/id/{region_id}` for future enrichment.
- [ ] Batch endpoint `POST {.../mmr-batch}/vins` (up to 100 VINs); no batch use case in ingest yet.
- [ ] Plumb `region`, `color`, `grade`, `date`, `extendedCoverage`, `orgId`, `excludeBuild` query params through `appendCoxQueryParams` when use cases land.

**Internal staging blockers:**
- [ ] Provision `INTEL_WORKER_URL` secret on main worker (staging URL of tav-intelligence-worker).
- [ ] Provision `INTEL_WORKER_SECRET` secret on main worker (any strong random value, matching below).
- [ ] Provision `INTEL_SERVICE_SECRET` secret on intelligence worker (same value as `INTEL_WORKER_SECRET`).
- [ ] Provision Cox sandbox secrets on intelligence worker: `MANHEIM_API_VENDOR=cox`, `MANHEIM_GRANT_TYPE=client_credentials`, `MANHEIM_SCOPE=wholesale-valuations.vehicle.mmr-ext.get`, `MANHEIM_CLIENT_ID`, `MANHEIM_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MANHEIM_TOKEN_URL`, `MANHEIM_MMR_URL`.
- [ ] tav-intelligence-worker must be deployed to staging (`workers_dev = true` is already set).
- [ ] End-to-end smoke test in staging: POST /ingest → verify `ingest.mmr_worker_called` + `valuation.fetched` log events appear and `tav.valuation_snapshots` row is written.
- [ ] After staging validation: set `MANHEIM_LOOKUP_MODE = "worker"` in `[env.staging.vars]` and redeploy main worker.

**Provisioning commands (staging) — full Cox set:**
```

These were the blockers *before* the cutover. Do NOT modify wrangler.toml IDs casually.

- [ ] 2026-05-08 wrangler.toml — provision TAV_INTEL_KV production namespace and replace placeholder ID:
      `wrangler kv namespace create TAV_INTEL_KV_PRODUCTION --config workers/tav-intelligence-worker/wrangler.toml --env production`
      Then paste the returned `id` into `[[env.production.kv_namespaces]] id = ...`

- [ ] 2026-05-08 wrangler.toml — provision TAV_INTEL_KV preview namespace (used by `wrangler dev` without --env) and replace both placeholder IDs:
      `wrangler kv namespace create TAV_INTEL_KV_PREVIEW --config workers/tav-intelligence-worker/wrangler.toml`
      Then paste `id` and `preview_id` into `[[kv_namespaces]]`

- [ ] 2026-05-08 wrangler.toml — confirm staging KV namespace has `preview_id` set in `[[env.staging.kv_namespaces]]`
      (currently only `id` is set; missing `preview_id` will cause `wrangler dev --env staging` to warn)

- [ ] 2026-05-08 secrets — provision production secrets (run each with --env production):
      MANHEIM_CLIENT_ID, MANHEIM_CLIENT_SECRET, MANHEIM_TOKEN_URL, MANHEIM_MMR_URL,
      SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, INTEL_SERVICE_SECRET
      — and conditionally: MANHEIM_USERNAME + MANHEIM_PASSWORD (password grant only),
      MANHEIM_GRANT_TYPE (only if client_credentials — confirm with Manheim rep first)
      `wrangler secret put <NAME> --config workers/tav-intelligence-worker/wrangler.toml --env production`

- [ ] 2026-05-08 wrangler.toml — set `workers_dev = true` under `[env.production]` once production secrets are provisioned,
      or use a Cloudflare Access policy to gate the production worker endpoint

- [x] 2026-05-08 supabase/migrations — apply migration 0033 (user_activity feed index + purge_expired_activity function)
      to remote before deploying production worker: `npx supabase db push` — DONE (confirmed via `supabase migration list`; remote is current through 0037)

## 2026-05-09 — production cutover follow-ups

- [ ] 2026-05-09 ops — distribute `WEBHOOK_HMAC_SECRET` (production) to Apify ingest team so they can sign /ingest payloads.
      Value lives in `~/.tav-prod-secrets.local` on the operator machine; share via the team's secret-distribution channel
      (1Password, Vault, etc.), not Slack/email plaintext.
- [ ] 2026-05-09 ops — distribute `ADMIN_API_SECRET` (production) to admin-tooling owners. Same channel as above.
- [ ] 2026-05-09 ops — once both above secrets are distributed, `shred -u ~/.tav-prod-secrets.local`
      (or `rm -P` on macOS). File is mode 600 and outside the repo, but should not linger after distribution.
- [ ] 2026-05-09 cox — production Cox MMR enablement is BLOCKED on Cox enabling the production environment for the
      TAV Evaluation app, or migrating to a separate Cox production app. Until then,
      `tav-intelligence-worker-production` runs against `https://sandbox.api.coxautoinc.com/wholesale-valuations/vehicle/mmr`
      using TAV Evaluation Sandbox Bridge 2 credentials (CLIENT_ID `a390ecdd-f036-479a-92d8-7794bcdb6afa`).
      Swap path when Cox enables prod: re-put `MANHEIM_TOKEN_URL`, `MANHEIM_MMR_URL`, `MANHEIM_CLIENT_ID`,
      `MANHEIM_CLIENT_SECRET`, optionally `MANHEIM_SCOPE` on intel-prod via `wrangler secret put` and redeploy.
      No code change required; worker reads these dynamically.
- [ ] 2026-05-09 wrangler.toml — `[env.production]` for `tav-intelligence-worker-production` keeps `workers_dev=false`
      (set during cutover after direct smoke). Re-enable temporarily via `workers_dev = true` + redeploy if direct
      diagnostic access is ever needed; revert after.
- [ ] 2026-05-09 docs — author production runbook entry covering: cutover state, rollback path (dashboard env-var flip
      to `MANHEIM_LOOKUP_MODE=direct`). Cox sandbox caveat is no longer relevant (Cox production live 2026-05-13).
      Reference docs/staging-smoke-2026-05-09.md "Production cutover" section for narrative.
- [ ] 2026-05-13 docs/manheim-uat-validation-plan.md — Cox production MMR is live; append a prod-mode UAT mirroring
      §3 with prod-real VINs (not example VIN `1FT8W3BT1SEC27066`). Promoted from "when Cox enables" to active item.

- [x] 2026-05-11 wrangler/secrets — provision `APP_API_SECRET` (Bearer for `/app/*` frontend API) on
      `tav-aip-staging` and `tav-aip-production`. DONE 2026-05-11 — both envs (rotated once after an accidental
      exposure, re-provisioned). `/app/*` deployed (staging Version `870e4af2`, prod Version `888c99a3`) and
      smoked PASS — see `docs/app-api-smoke-2026-05-11.md`. See ADR 0002.
- [x] 2026-05-11 src/app/routes — `GET /app/import-batches` (thin wrapper over `listImportBatches`; `?limit` default 20,
      clamp 100, fallback 20 on bad/zero/negative/fractional/non-numeric; 503 `db_error` on client-init or query failure).
      DONE 2026-05-11 — ADR 0002 §"Endpoint contracts" marked implemented; tests in `test/app.routes.test.ts`.
      Not yet deployed (awaiting review).
- [x] 2026-05-11 src/app/routes — `GET /app/historical-sales` (new `persistence/historicalSales.ts` over
      `tav.historical_sales`; `?limit` default 20 / clamp 100 / fallback 20; optional exact-match `year`/`make`/`model`,
      `since` → `sale_date >=`; ordered `sale_date DESC`; 503 `db_error` on client-init or query failure).
      DONE 2026-05-11 — ADR 0002 §"Endpoint contracts" marked implemented; tests in `test/app.routes.test.ts`.
      Not yet deployed (batched with import-batches, awaiting deploy confirmation).
- [x] 2026-05-11 src/app/routes — `POST /app/mmr/vin` (Zod body `{vin, year?, mileage?}` — narrower than the intel
      layer's `MmrVinLookupRequestSchema`; reuses `getMmrValueFromWorker`, Service-Binding transport; non-blocking —
      `intel_worker_not_configured` / `no_mmr_value` / `intel_worker_timeout` / `intel_worker_rate_limited` /
      `intel_worker_unavailable` → `200 {ok:true,data:{mmrValue:null,missingReason}}`; bad body → 400; unexpected
      error → 503 `internal_error`). DONE 2026-05-11 — ADR 0002 marked implemented; tests in `test/app.routes.test.ts`.
- [x] 2026-05-11 deploy — all 5 `/app/*` endpoints implemented AND deployed. Round 2 (`import-batches`,
      `historical-sales`, `mmr/vin`) deployed to `tav-aip-staging` (Version `f3c3c3d8`) then `tav-aip-production`
      (Version `127f532a`); 6-check smoke PASS on both envs (incl. `POST /app/mmr/vin` `1FT8W3BT1SEC27066` →
      `mmrValue:68600 confidence:high method:vin` on sandbox Cox). Recorded in `docs/app-api-smoke-2026-05-11.md`
      "Round 2".
- [x] 2026-05-11 supabase — global outcome-rollup view. DONE 2026-05-11 — migration `0041_outcome_summary_global_view.sql`
      adds `tav.v_outcome_summary_global` (single-row, no GROUP BY; column formulas mirror `v_outcome_summary` sans
      `region`, so a true global `AVG`, not a mean-of-region-means). `GET /app/kpis` `outcomes.value` exposes
      `totalOutcomes` / `avgGrossProfit` / `avgHoldDays` / `lastOutcomeAt` + `byRegion`; NULL aggregates (empty
      table) pass through as `null`. Schema snapshot + ADR 0002 + `docs/APP_API.md` updated. (Initially also
      exposed `sellThroughRate`; removed same day — see the sell-through item below.)
- [x] 2026-05-11 product — `sellThroughRate` semantics for `/app/kpis`. RESOLVED 2026-05-11 (Option 1) — removed
      `sellThroughRate` from the `/app/kpis` `outcomes.value` response. The SQL views (`v_outcome_summary` /
      `v_outcome_summary_global`) keep their `sell_through_rate` column unchanged; it's simply not surfaced via the
      frontend API. The formula is correct (`COUNT(*) FILTER (sale_price IS NOT NULL) / COUNT(*)`); the problem is
      product semantics — `tav.purchase_outcomes` currently holds only sold/imported outcome rows (every row has a
      `sale_price`), so the ratio is tautologically `1.0` and returning it would mislead the frontend. `handleKpis`
      doc comment + `docs/APP_API.md` + ADR 0002 + test expectations updated. Pure API change — no migration, views
      untouched.
- [ ] product/data — build a true sell-through metric once the lead→purchase / acquisition-persistence workflow
      writes `tav.purchase_outcomes` rows *before* resale (i.e. inventory bought-but-not-yet-sold; `sale_price IS NULL`
      then means "in inventory"). At that point `sell_through_rate` becomes meaningful and can be re-surfaced via
      `/app/kpis`; also strip the now-meaningful-or-not `sell_through_rate` column from the raw `byRegion` rows the
      endpoint passes through (today they still carry it verbatim — see `docs/app-api-smoke-2026-05-11.md` Round 5).
      Blocked on that workflow — it is not a query change. (A normal follow-up; no /gsd-plant-seed.)
- [x] 2026-05-11 src — persist stale-sweep cron run times. DONE 2026-05-11 — migration `0042_cron_runs.sql` adds
      `tav.cron_runs` (job-agnostic audit log: `job_name`, `started_at`, `finished_at`, `status` ok|failed,
      `detail` jsonb). `src/index.ts` `scheduled()` records each run via `recordCronRunSafe` (best-effort —
      audit-write failure never fails the cron; failed sweeps still get a `status:"failed"` row + rethrow).
      `src/persistence/cronRuns.ts` = new (`recordCronRun` / `recordCronRunSafe` / `getLastCronRun`).
      `GET /app/system-status` `staleSweep` now `{ lastRunAt, status, updated }` from the latest `stale_sweep`
      row, or `{ lastRunAt:null, missingReason:"never_run"|"db_error" }`. Tests: `test/cronRuns.test.ts` (helper),
      `test/scheduled.test.ts` (write path), `test/app.routes.test.ts` (system-status read path). schema.sql + ADR
      0002 + `docs/APP_API.md` updated. Migration 0042 applied to the linked DB; deployed to `tav-aip-staging`
      (Version `157b83ee`) + `tav-aip-production` (Version `4d73da7c`); smoke PASS both envs (`staleSweep` =
      `{lastRunAt:null,missingReason:"never_run"}` pre-cron). See `docs/app-api-smoke-2026-05-11.md` "Round 4".
- [ ] 2026-05-12 spot-check — after the first 06:00 UTC `scheduled()` run post-deploy, confirm `tav.cron_runs` has a
      `job_name='stale_sweep'` row (`status`, `detail.updated`) and `GET /app/system-status` `staleSweep.lastRunAt`
      is a real timestamp (not `null` / `missingReason:"never_run"`). One-time check; close once verified.
- [x] 2026-05-11 docs — write `docs/APP_API.md` formal contract doc for `/app/*`. DONE 2026-05-11 — covers auth,
      envelope/conventions, all 5 endpoints, response shapes, worker config, frontend integration notes; ADR 0002
      "Consequences" updated to point at it as source of truth.
- [x] 2026-05-11 .dev.vars.example — stale `MANHEIM_LOOKUP_MODE` comment ("worker (not yet implemented)"). DONE
      2026-05-11 — comment rewritten to "direct = direct-to-Cox (code default, fine for local) / worker = via
      tav-intelligence-worker, staging+prod run this (cutover 2026-05-09)". Also fixed the matching stale comment in
      `wrangler.toml` (`[[env.production.kv_namespaces]]` block said "Bound but dormant … keeps worker-mode dark
      until cutover greenlit" → now "Active — MANHEIM_LOOKUP_MODE=worker (cutover 2026-05-09); via INTEL_WORKER
      binding"). Note: top-level `[vars] MANHEIM_LOOKUP_MODE = "direct"` left as-is — it's the base/local default and
      both deployed envs override it to `"worker"`.
- [ ] 2026-05-11 lint — `npm run lint` exits 1 on 4 legacy root scripts (`test-mmr.js`, `backfill-mmr.js`,
      `normalizer-worker.js`, `enrichment-worker.js`): ~97 errors (`no-undef`, `no-console`). Decide: gitignore /
      delete the throwaway scripts, or add an eslint override. Pre-existing; unrelated to ADR 0002 work.
- [ ] 2026-05-12 web — local `pnpm dev` needs follow-up around Next 16 proxy/dev behavior + env setup. Current state:
      `web/proxy.ts` now exports a named `proxy` function that awaits the lazy `auth()` handler (Next 16 rejected the
      old `export const proxy = auth(...)` shape, and the lazy `NextAuth(() => config)` form makes `auth(handler)`
      return a Promise, not a function). With that fixed, `pnpm dev` no longer throws the proxy-export error — but it
      then fails because `.env.local` isn't populated (`APP_API_BASE_URL`, `APP_API_SECRET`, `AUTH_SECRET`,
      `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`). Not blocking Phase 1: production-like browser/OAuth/manual QA happens
      on Vercel Preview before launch (Task 1.23). When someone wants working local dev, populate `web/.dev.vars` /
      `.env.local` and re-smoke. (noticed by: user + claude)
- [ ] 2026-05-12 web/ci — with `typedRoutes: true`, `pnpm typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) only passes if `.next/types/**`
      has been generated by a prior `next build` (or `next dev`). On a clean checkout, running `pnpm typecheck`
      before `pnpm build` fails (`<Link href>` / `redirect()` to app routes resolve to `RouteImpl<...>`). Task 1.22's
      `web-ci` workflow runs lint→typecheck→build in that order — either reorder (build first, or a `next build`/types
      pre-step) or accept the dependency. (noticed by: claude)
- [x] 2026-05-13 web/dashboard — `bucketGrossByMonth` and its tests are currently dashboard-local at
      `web/app/(app)/dashboard/_components/bucket-gross-by-month.{ts,test.ts}`. Promote to
      `web/lib/historical-aggregate.ts` when Phase 4 (segment-trend chart) lands so the helper isn't duplicated.
      (noticed by: user) — DONE in Phase 4; helper lives at `web/lib/historical-aggregate.ts`.
- [ ] 2026-05-13 web/e2e — dashboard e2e currently asserts the happy-path surface only. Server-side first paint
      (`appApiServer`) is driven by the gated `/api/e2e-mocks/app/*` route, and per-test scenario switching (e.g. db
      down, outcomes unavailable) needs either a state-mutating mock endpoint or an env/header-driven scenario
      picker. Add when a deferred case actually pays off in regression coverage. (noticed by: claude)
- [x] 2026-05-13 Cox MMR production cutover — `tav-intelligence-worker-production` rotated from Cox sandbox to Cox
      production credentials (`MANHEIM_CLIENT_ID`, `MANHEIM_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MANHEIM_TOKEN_URL`, `MANHEIM_MMR_URL`).
      Dashboard sandbox copy removed in `codex/fix-cox-production-copy`: `web/app/(app)/mmr-lab/page.tsx`
      `CaveatBanner` deleted; `web/app/(app)/admin/_components/admin-client.tsx` Cox-sandbox `CaveatBanner` + label
      flipped to "Production-enabled"; example-VIN "Fill example (sandbox VIN)" → "Fill example"; admin/mmr-lab e2e
      assertions updated; `docs/APP_API.md`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-web-frontend-design.md`,
      `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-11-web-frontend.md` updated. No machine-readable Cox-environment flag exists in
      `/app/system-status` yet — admin label is operator-managed config state. Follow-up: add
      `system-status.cox.environment` so the label can be a runtime signal.
- [ ] 2026-05-13 backend — add `cox.environment` (or equivalent) field to `GET /app/system-status` so the dashboard
      can self-detect Cox vendor environment instead of carrying a static operator-managed label. (noticed by: claude)
- [ ] 2026-05-13 ops — confirm `pnpm test:contract` against staging still passes after Cox prod cutover. Staging Cox
      account remains sandbox; only production was rotated. Run once after deploy; close if green.
